# UT-Hitboxes

------------------------------Hitboxes Mod------------------------------

This is the 1.5 patch!!

I have found a few more bugs that are being patched out.

NOTE: this will NOT be updated along with Clover's Practice Mod, but I am working on to make it more compatable with other versions of undertale

------------------------------ Keybinds(that I added)------------------------------

YGHJ(overworld)---move 1 3rd of a pixel in the respective directions (like wasd)

Tab (in battle)---makes you invincible in any battle that uses the obj_heart object (most)
(does NOT work for Sans)

Tab (overworld)---changes if you can see the hitboxes or not (if you want to learn a pixel lineup, ect.)

C (intro menu)---settings for the mod

------------------------------Known bugs\missing hitboxes------------------------------

I have found a few missing/offset hitboxes that I missed

------------------------------Other info------------------------------

All code that was changed/added by me can be downloaded
